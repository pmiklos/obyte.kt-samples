# Obyte.kt Examples

Obyte.kt is a multi-platform Kotlin library to communicate with hub nodes in the Obyte cryptocurrency network.

All examples will connect to the Obyte testnet and start a heartbeat to keep the connection open while displaying the incoming and outgoing messages.

## JVM

To run the JVM example run:

```bash
./gradlew jvm:run
```

## Javascript (Browser) 

```bash
./gradlew js:run
```
This will start webpack and open the default browser with the application.
